Overlook is my final Mod 2 project. I wasn't able to get everything in that I would of liked but do feel like, I also was able to focus on sharpening some skills I have been neglecting. The project is a hotel management website, you are able to interact with it as a guest, as well as on the back of house as a manager. 

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/api/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is a mock hotel, management, and guest portal. You are able to log in as a manager and look at current sales. As a guest you can search available rooms, make a booking. Future iterations will includ a mock ammenities section, a page that goes, into much more detail about the hotel. Future iterations on the manager side will include a much more robust back of house operations application, more details about the day to day as well as abilities to add service charges.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `box-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
