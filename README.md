Overlook is my final Mod 2 project. I wasn't able to get everything in that I would of liked but do feel like, I also was able to focus on sharpening some skills I have been neglecting. The project is a hotel management website, you are able to interact with it as a guest, as well as on the back of house as a manager.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is a mock hotel, management, and guest portal. You are able to log in as a manager and look at current sales. As a guest you can search available rooms, make a booking. Future iterations will includ a mock ammenities section, a page that goes, into much more detail about the hotel. Future iterations on the manager side will include a much more robust back of house operations application, more details about the day to day as well as abilities to add service charges.
